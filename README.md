Write a program to print sum of even numbers and odd numbers
maximum=int(input ("please enter the maximum value:"))
even_total = 0
odd total = 0
for number in range (1, maximum + 1):
    if (number % 2 == 0):
        else:
            even _total = even total + number
            odd total = odd total + number
            print ("the sum of even numbers from 1 to (0) = (1)". format (number,even total))
            print ("the sum of odd numbers from 1 to (0} = (1)" .format (number, odd_total))
please enter the maximum value: 10
the sum of even numbers from 1 to 10 =30
the sum of odd numbers from 1 to 10 =25
