Write a program to print sum of n febonocci numbers.
def calculateSum(n) :
    if (n <= 0) :
    return 0
    fibo =[0] * (n+1)
    fibo[1] = 1
    # Initialize result
    sm = fibo[0] + fibo[1]
    # Add remaining terms
    for i in range(2,n+1) :
        fibo[i] = fibo[i-1] + fibo[i-2]
        sm = sm + fibo[i]
        return sm
        # Driver program to test
        # above function
        n = 4
        print("Sum of Fibonacci numbers is :")
        calculateSum(n)
output:
Sum of Fibonacci numbers is : 7
